This is the Owasco Model that is behind the Soil and Water Lab saturated areas tool:

Version control using Git started 3/12/2013 because of substantial changes that we are hoping to make:
1.  Incorporate Salmon Creek into the model
2.  Provide a way to store the input data more effectively (precip and temp data)
3.  Update twice a day - once at 3 am to allow for best prediction for farmers, and once at 10:30 am to better incorporate observed data.


Other goals :  
- Better modulation - separate data gathering from the actual model run and data storage.  
- Make the code easier to use.
